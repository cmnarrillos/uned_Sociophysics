#  Code used for "Sociophysics and Social Networks" subject at UNED

This repository contains code samples for the different
tasks made associated to the subject ["Sociofísica y Redes Sociales"](https://portal.uned.es/portal/page?_pageid=93,71542273&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&idAsignatura=21156191&idTitulacion=215801)
at Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED) 
for the academic year 2022-2023.

Different unrelated tasks had to be done, so different 
subdirectories have been employed:

- Opinion_Dynamics_threshold: contains some functionalities to analyse Galam's opinion dynamics model
- Opinion_Dynamics_models: implements and tests different sociophysical models:
  - Voter model for opinion dynamics
  - Sznajd model for opinion dynamics
  - Axelrod model for cultural dynamics
  - Schelling model for segregation analysis based on slightly biased individual preferences
- Complex_Network: analyzes a complex network of ["General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology arXiv academic collaboration"](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-GrQc.html)
